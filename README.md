# DeepData

## Introduction
    Website that contains databases for registration, administration, deep thought, and client data implemantation. 
    Then that data is visualized, so the deep questions that are asked have a statistical presence.

## Information
    This website was chosen to be hosted by render since it is a free website host for both server and client-side. 
    Because of this, the host has the requirement that if a website hasn't been used in a while, 
    the server will be shut down until a user tries to use any server functions in the website. 
    So, if you experience any problems starting up in the website, this is because the server is starting up.
